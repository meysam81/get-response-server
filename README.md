# get-response-server
This service has one protocol and one protocol only (you may add to it later),  
but for now this is how you can communicate to this app.
## Quick Start
To start with, you're going to need rebar3 which you   
can get from [HERE](https://github.com/erlang/rebar3)

After that, the next step is to clone this repository to your local computer  
using the following command in your **linux** terminal  
`git clone git@github.com:meysam81/get-response-server.git`

Next step is easy, you should change your current directory to  
the directory of this repository which you can accomplish  
from the following command in your **linux** terminal  
`cd get-response-server`

From here on, your work is easy. Just enter the following command  
in your **linux** terminal  
`make rel-dev && make console-dev`

And now your service is up and running and awaiting requests from  
clients.

I have provided a sample client for you which you can get using  
the [THIS LINK](https://github.com/meysam81/get-response-client)

### Acknowledment
I should thank my [mentor](https://github.com/mohsenmoqadam) for showing me the path to the new world  
of programming, that is the programming to _change the world_
